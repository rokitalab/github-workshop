Please complete all setup tasks __prior__ to the workshop, as we will not have time to go through installation steps and complete all goals of the workshop. 

If you need any assistance with the installation, please contact Ryan Corbett (corbettr@chop.edu)

## Workshop software requirements

### Visual Studio Code

We will be writing code using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) text editor during the workshop, so we recommend downloading this if you do not have a preferred text editor. 
Alternatively, other text editors can be used such as [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com), or [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/). 

## Account Setup

### Github

You will need to create a [GitHub.com](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) for detailed account setup instructions. 


### Docker

We will be using Docker to showcase software and package tracking within Github repositories. Please download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) prior to the workshop.
